/**
 * Application service for the `/me` surface. Sits between
 * `UsersController` (HTTP boundary, zod validation) and `UsersRepo` +
 * `ScheduleService` (data + scheduling adapters).
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. **Read profile (`getProfile`)** — load the row, project it into
 *      the documented `/me` shape, and substitute the documented
 *      defaults (60 / 1440) for any cadence field that has never been
 *      patched. Clients should never see `undefined` here; the docs
 *      promise numbers.
 *
 *   2. **Patch cadence (`updateCadence`)** — the entire reason
 *      `UsersService` exists. The HTTP layer can't combine
 *      "persist + register jobs" because the controller MUST stay free
 *      of `ScheduleService` knowledge so the adapter swap in #5 only
 *      touches the schedule module. The orchestration also has a
 *      meaningful failure shape:
 *
 *        - Repo throws → schedule is NOT called. The contract is
 *          "register jobs against the new cadence", not "register
 *          jobs against whatever cadence happens to be in flight". A
 *          half-applied state would re-poll on the old interval and
 *          confuse anyone debugging the failure.
 *
 *        - Schedule throws → wrap the error in `ScheduleSyncError`
 *          before rethrowing. The controller maps that to `502`
 *          (upstream dependency failure), the same shape
 *          `AuthController` already uses for X / Appwrite outages.
 *          The repo state is committed at this point — that's
 *          deliberate. The next successful PATCH (whether from this
 *          user or from #5's eventual reconciliation worker) will
 *          re-sync.
 *
 * Why error wrapping instead of letting the raw error propagate: the
 * controller needs a stable signal to distinguish "the user gave us
 * bad input" (zod 400) from "the database broke" (500) from "the
 * scheduler dependency broke" (502). Without the wrapper the
 * controller would have to `instanceof` against BullMQ / Redis errors
 * directly, leaking the adapter into the HTTP layer.
 */

/**
 * Documented defaults for the cadence fields. Mirrors `data-model.md`
 * (the schema marks both fields optional so the app-layer default
 * applies to never-patched users) and `api.md` (the example response
 * uses 60 / 1440). Centralised here so any future change has exactly
 * one source of truth.
